## Securing your site like it's 2019
The truth is that since the early days of the web, the stakes of a security breach have become much, much higher. The web is so much more than fandom and mailing DVDs - online banking is now mainstream, social media and dating websites store intimate information about our personal lives, and we are even [inviting the internet into our homes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things).

However, we have powerful new allies helping us stay safe. There are more resources than ever before to teach us how to write secure code. Tools like [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) are designed with security features baked-in from the start. We have a new generation of security tools like [npm audit](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/173719309445/npm-audit-identify-and-fix-insecure) to watch over our dependencies.

As we roll over into 2019, let's take the opportunity to reflect on the security of the code we write and be grateful for the everything we've learned in the last twenty years.
